# Title

> Puns, jokes, or “hooks” in titles are okay, but make sure that if all someone knew was the title, they still would have some idea what the presentation is about.

## Duration

You pick 30/45 minutes from a dropdown.

> Committee note: There are far fewer 45 minute slots available than 30 minute slots, so not every accepted talk that requests a longer slot may be able to get it. If you select a 45 minute slot, please indicate in your outline (below) what content could be cut — if possible — for a 30 minute version.

## Description

> Edit using Markdown.
> Both your title and this description are made public and displayed in the conference program to help attendees decide whether they are interested in this presentation. Limit this description to a few concise paragraphs.

## Who and Why (Audience)

> 1–2 paragraphs that should answer three questions: (1) Who is this talk for? (2) What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to have? (3) What do you expect the audience to learn or do after watching the talk?

> Committee note: The “Audience” section helps the program committee get a sense of whether your talk is geared more at novices or experienced individuals in a given subject. (We need a balance of both lower-level and advanced talks to make a great PyCon!) It also helps us evaluate the relevance of your talk to the Python community.

## Outline

> The “outline” is a skeleton of your talk that is as detailed as possible, including rough timings for different sections. If requesting a 45 minute slot, please describe what content would appear in the 45 minute version but not a 30 minute version, either within the outline or in a paragraph at the end.

> Committee note: The outline is extremely important for the program committee to understand what the content and structure of your talk will be. We hope that writing the outline is helpful to you as well, to organize and clarify your thoughts for your talk! The outline will not be shared with conference attendees.

> If there’s too much to your topic to cover even in 45 minutes, you may wish to narrow it down. Alternatively, consider submitting a 3-hour PyCon tutorial instead.

## Additional notes

> Anything else you would like to share with the committee:
> Speaker public speaking experience.
> Speaker subject matter experience.
> Have the speaker(s) given this presentation before elsewhere?
> Links to recordings, slides, blog posts, code, or other material.
> Specific needs or special requests — accessibility, audio (will you need to play pre-recorded sound?), or restrictions on when your talk can be scheduled.
